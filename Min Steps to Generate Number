The main crux is that you start with 1 and keep multiplying 2 and adding the new number to a set. 
When your number becomes greater than the target you check if (num // 3) is present in the set of not. 
If it is present, it means you had already encountered this number previously and
so no point in dividing by 3 and just multiply by 2 further

num = 1
count = 0
visited = set()
visited.add(1)
while(num != target):
    if (num > target) and ((num // 3) not in visited):
        num //= 3
    else:
        num *= 2
        
    visited.add(num)
    count += 1

return count
